Project Description: With my project I will take the last 10 years of gas consumption and then given current data I will try to forecast the next 10 years of gas sales and see how it fairs. Will there be a steep decline or is this year due to the pandemic the lowest point for the gas industry as it pertains to the next 10 years.
